[introduction]
= Introduction

The Kraken API is a RESTful web service that delivers OEM content.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

The Kraken API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, overwrites all fields

| `PATCH`
| Used for partial updates to an existing resource

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

The Kraken API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes. For example,

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `405 Method Not Allowed`
| The type of request for this resource is not allowed. For example, some endpoints may be GET only.
Trying a POST will return this message.
|===

For more status codes, see the https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[w3 standard]

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to delete on a disallowed endpoint will produce a
`405 Method Not Allowed` response:

operation::error-example[snippets='curl-request,http-request,http-response']

[[security]]
== Security

This API utilizes SuiteSecurity. The token should be provided as an Authorization field in the request headers, like so:

operation::bulletins-post-example[snippets='curl-request,http-request']

[[change-management]]
== Change Management

=== Versioning

Major versions will be released at different subdomains, such as version 1 at

`http://dev-kraken-1.apps-dev.gp1-cf.solera.com/`

and version 2 at

`http://dev-kraken-2.apps-dev.gp1-cf.solera.com/`.

Consumers will *not* be redirected from one version of a service to another.
To do so would invite bad practice and brittle client code. Instead, consumers should monitor
deprecation warnings and migrate accordingly. Most consumers should be able to migrate by
updating to the latest version of the client library and making any further changes from there.

=== Deprecation

Deprecation warnings will appear in response headers to warn of upcoming changes to endpoints based on the actual
usage of that endpoint.
This may be due to upcoming endpoint relocation or removal, or a change to a particular parameter.
For example, a request to an endpoint that is slated for removal will return a warning to all consumers,
but a request to an endpoint that does not specify a value for a 'sort-order' parameter that is slated for removal
will not generate a warning.
